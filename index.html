    <h2>About us - Mission</h2>
    <p>We, board members of Co-Lab Co., chartered to create applications for the benefit of communities all around the country.
      The product we have planned to design is called Co-Lab. At its deepest core, Co-Lab is meant to help connect members of a community with those in need in the same community. 
      The successful implementation should make it easy for anyone to get assistance with tasks, labor, and plain donations while also supplying organizations with an easy means to assist those in their community. .
      The Co-Lab product is intended to improve communities by providing an easy method for assistance. We envision this to primarily consist of non-profit organizations and food pantries collaborating with community members in need.
      These members could consist of the homeless, the elderly, physically and/or the mentally challenged/disabled. 
      Having a desire to help and assist those in your community can become complicated and messy if not done right. Co-Lab does it for you.
